## Create a virtual env and install dependency from requirements.txt

A Python virtual environment is an isolated folder structure that holds a specific Python interpreter and its own set of libraries/packages. It ensures project-specific dependencies do not interfere with other projects or the global system installation, allowing different projects to use different versions of the same library without conflicts.

Key Functions of a Virtual Environment:Isolation: 

Creates a "bubble" for each project, keeping dependencies contained and separate.Conflict Prevention: Prevents package version conflicts (e.g., Project A needing Django 3.0 while Project B needs Django 4.0).

Version Management: Allows different projects to use different versions of Python or libraries.

Cleaner System: Avoids cluttering the global Python installation with unnecessary packages.

Reproducibility: Makes it easy to share projects by creating a list of dependencies (requirements.txt) specifically for that environment.

## create a virtaul env
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## activate virtual env
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## PowerShell
```bash
\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## WindowsCommand Prompt.
```bash
\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## macOS/Linuxbash / zshsource 
```bash
.venv/bin/activate
```

# deactivate
```bash
venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat
```

# Install Dependency while virtual env activated
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Build the source code

# Build Application file

## Run application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

# Stop streamlit app
```bash
ctrl+c
```


# Updates gitignore file then push code to github

# track file
```bash
git add .
```

# to see tracked all files
```bash
git status
```
# commits the changes to stagging area
